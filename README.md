# UF OSC Drone Documentation

This website ([view here](https://ufosc-drone-docs.vercel.app/)) is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```bash
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

The built site can be served locally as follows.

```bash
$ npm run serve
```

### Deployment

This website is deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)'s serverless hosting [here](https://ufosc-drone-docs.vercel.app/).
