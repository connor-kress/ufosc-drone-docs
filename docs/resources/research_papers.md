### An Autonomous Path Planning Method for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle based on A Tangent Intersection and Target Guidance Strategy:

The paper “An Autonomous Path Planning Method for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle based on A Tangent Intersection and Target Guidance Strategy” introduces a novel algorithm for UAV path planning. This method ensures efficient obstacle avoidance and target guidance, generating collision-free paths in real-time. The approach leverages an elliptic tangent graph and cubic B-spline curves to optimize UAV navigation in complex environments
