## To Do
- Cover the barometer on the navio2 flight controller with a piece of cell foam before drone use outside
- Design/3d-print adapter mount and screw to bottom of frame (for camera)
- Install camera
    - Determine which camera to use
        - If using normal raspberry pi camera:
            - (If using tool): Use Camera (when on drone) to collect data, sort through images to make a dataset, and train a model; then, put into TensorFlow Lite and load onto raspberry pi
- Figure out: ROS or ROS 2?
    - Get materials that alex wanted to refactor in C/C++, figure out
- Use Edge ML tool or build from Scratch? (also dependent on camera)
    - First Goal: Object Detection
